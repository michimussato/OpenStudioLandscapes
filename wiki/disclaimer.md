I'm not 
- a Software Architect
- a Systems Engineer
- a Bash Guru
- a Python Master
by any means.

However, I often did find myself (as a TD) in a juggling - sometimes fun and 
sometimes less fun - game within those realms. This is exactly
where and why this story started.

I tried to apply my very limited knowledge about Python Packaging, Docker Containers,
Git, Linux Shell etc. etc. so I'm sure you might find one or the other 
quirk that is not best practice. If you do, don't hesitate to reach out, 
point it out and suggest a better way to do it.

`OpenStudioLandscapes`, as such, is not a GUI application. If you don't have
(or are not willing to gain) some basic Linux shell and/or Python skills you might 
struggle a bit - especially in the beginning. 
However, the goal of this project is that everyone *should* be able to 
overcome technical difficulties and to get a Landscape up and running 
in a small amount of time - with guidance, video tutorials and (once 
established) the community.

This project is built using Dagster. Hence, getting familiar with
some Dagster basics is recommended (if not required). Check
out Dagster Labs' [Dagster Essentials](https://courses.dagster.io/courses/dagster-essentials).

This also applies to contributions: Dagster familiarity is a requirement when it 
comes to understanding the structure. However, if you find ways to improve the 
project also in Dagster-unrelated ways, don't hesitate to make a suggestion.
